  Generate thought leadership content using Elixirr's AI transformation frameworks. Creates blog posts, LinkedIn posts, articles, whitepapers, and presentation talking points. Use when anyone mentions writing, drafting, or creating content about AI transformation, AI adoption, AI strategy, organizational change for AI, digital transformation, or any topic where Elixirr's frameworks could add a distinctive perspective. Also triggers for "write a post", "draft an article", "content about", "thought piece on", "LinkedIn post".

# Thought Leadership Generator

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Request

Clarify what you're writing:
- **Topic or angle**: What's the core idea? (e.g., "why AI pilots fail", "measuring AI transformation progress", "building AI-ready talent")
- **Format**: LinkedIn post, blog article, long-form article, or talking points?
- **Audience**: Who's reading this? (executives, practitioners, board members?)
- **Goal**: What action or shift do we want to trigger? (awareness, credibility, engagement, lead generation?)

### 2. Read the Voice Guide

Read `../references/elixirr-voice.md` to internalize:
- Tone (authoritative, practical, provocative, specific)
- Vocabulary (avoid jargon, favor direct language)
- Writing patterns (diagnostic questions, concrete examples, frameworks as invisible infrastructure)

### 3. Identify Relevant Frameworks

Based on the topic, determine which frameworks apply:
- **Three Forces** (Pace, Breadth, Depth) — for industry shifts, AI adoption challenges
- **10-Layer Operating System** (Layers 1-10) — for sequencing, priorities, organizational design
- **75 Failure Patterns** — for diagnostic content, pattern recognition
- **Maturity Model** (Exploring → Piloting → Scaling → Operating) — for where companies get stuck
- **Outcome-First Strategy** — for measurement, value realization
- **Augmented Professional** (Five Thresholds, identity shift) — for workforce transformation, role redesign
- **Solution Design** — for methodology, approach rigor

Read the relevant framework references from `../references/` (e.g., `../references/framework-core.md` for Three Forces and OS, `../references/failure-patterns.md`, `../references/augmented-professional.md`, etc.).

### 4. Research for Data & Examples

Run web searches to gather:
- **Current examples**: Real companies, recent announcements, case studies
- **Data points**: Statistics on AI adoption, transformation challenges, ROI
- **Trends**: What's shifting in the industry right now?
- **Competitive landscape**: How are others talking about AI transformation?

Make 3-5 specific, recent data points to ground the content (not generic stats).

### 5. Draft Content

Write using the format guidance below. Aim for the target length. Remember:
- Frameworks should feel like original thinking, not citations. Never say "According to the AI Transformation Operating System" — just use the thinking.
- Ground every claim with examples or data from your research.
- The Elixirr voice: authoritative, practical, provocative, specific.
- Use diagnostic questions as hooks ("Ask yourself: are you measuring activity or outcomes?")
- Make it personal — address readers directly, create tension, offer insight.

After drafting, save to user's workspace with a descriptive filename:
`<workspace>/[Format] - [Topic] - [DRAFT].md`

### 6. Iterate with User

Share the draft and ask: "What would make this sharper? More specific? What's missing?" Refine until the user approves.

### 7. Export & Deliver

Once approved:
- **LinkedIn post / short content**: Keep as Markdown, copy link
- **Blog article / long-form**: Convert to .docx using your editor (preserve formatting and links)

Share the final file and ask where they want to use it.

## Format Guidance

### LinkedIn Post (600-1200 words)

**Structure:**
- Hook in first 2 lines (question, counterintuitive claim, or scenario)
- Single key insight or argument (one main point, deeply explored)
- 2-3 supporting examples or data points
- Closing: call to reflection or conversation starter

**Tone:** Conversational, first-person, thought-provoking.

**Key elements:**
- Open with something provocative: "Most AI transformations fail at the same place..."
- Use concrete examples (specific companies, situations, outcomes)
- Reference a framework without naming it (e.g., discuss the "layers" of transformation without saying "10-Layer OS")
- Close with a question: "What's your experience? I'm curious..."

**Example hook:** "I've asked this question to 50+ executives over the past year. Almost none answer it well."

### Blog Article (1500-2500 words)

**Structure:**
- Title + standfirst (2-3 sentences summarizing the argument)
- Introduction: establish the problem and why it matters
- Section 1: Frame the challenge (use one framework to diagnose)
- Section 2: Unpack deeper (additional framework, patterns, nuance)
- Section 3: Reframe toward action (what leaders can do differently)
- Closing: summary + invitation to deeper work
- 2-3 diagnostic questions embedded throughout

**Tone:** Authoritative, practical, specific to a real problem.

**Includes:**
- 3-5 industry-specific data points
- 2-3 concrete examples (companies, situations, outcomes)
- Frameworks embedded naturally (you're thinking out loud, not citing)
- 2-3 diagnostic questions for readers to ask themselves

### Long-Form Article (3000+ words)

**Structure:**
- Title + abstract
- Introduction (establish inflection point and stakes)
- Section 1: The forces driving change (Three Forces applied to a domain)
- Section 2: Why traditional approaches break (pattern analysis)
- Section 3: A different framework (OS layers, sequencing, diagnostic model)
- Section 4: What it means for different roles/functions (Augmented Professional dimension)
- Section 5: How to get started (Outcome-First approach, first 90 days)
- Section 6: The deeper work ahead (reference to fuller frameworks)
- Conclusion: why this matters now
- 5-7 diagnostic questions throughout

**Tone:** Deep, authoritative, comprehensive.

**Includes:**
- Multiple frameworks woven together naturally
- 8-10 data points and examples
- Real-world case examples (specific challenges, approaches, outcomes)
- Executive summaries within sections

### Talking Points (Slide-by-Slide)

**Format:** Structured outline, 10-15 slides with speaker notes.

**For each slide:**
- Slide title (provocative, clear)
- 2-3 bullet points (the "what" to say)
- Speaker notes (the "how" to say it, examples, elaboration)

**Flow:**
1. Inflection point (why now?)
2. Three Forces applied to domain
3. Current state diagnosis (maturity, failure patterns)
4. The gap (what's breaking)
5. Framework shift (new way of thinking)
6. OS Layer 1-2 (strategy, leadership signal)
7. OS Layers 3-5 (execution readiness)
8. OS Layers 6-10 (infrastructure, culture, measurement)
9. Role implications (Augmented Professional)
10. First priorities (what to do this quarter)
11. Measurement and outcomes
12. Key questions to ask your team
13. Invitation to deeper work

**Speaker notes** should include:
- Specific examples
- Data points to reference
- Common objections and responses
- Tactical next steps

## Key Principles

1. **Frameworks as invisible infrastructure**: Use the thinking, not the names. The reader should never feel lectured about frameworks.

2. **Ground everything in examples**: Every claim backed by a real example or statistic. "Many companies struggle with" → "IBM, Unilever, and JP Morgan all hit a wall when..."

3. **Diagnostic questions as engagement hooks**: Questions that make readers stop and assess their own situation. "Ask yourself: are you measuring activity or outcomes?" "How many of your AI investments have failed to scale past the pilot?"

4. **The Elixirr voice**:
   - Authoritative (you know this domain deeply)
   - Practical (advice you can act on today)
   - Provocative (ideas that challenge conventional wisdom)
   - Specific (details, examples, concrete scenarios — never generic)

5. **Address the reader directly**: Use second person. Make it personal. "Your AI strategy probably looks like..."

6. **One idea, deeply**: Don't try to cover everything. Pick one insight and explore it fully.

7. **Honor the complexity**: Transformation is hard. Don't pretend it's simple. Show how frameworks help navigate the complexity.
