description: Generate thought leadership content (blog posts, LinkedIn, articles) using Elixirr's AI transformation frameworks

# /thought-piece

Create thought leadership content that showcases Elixirr's distinctive thinking on AI transformation. Frameworks power the thinking invisibly — the output reads as genuine expertise, not a framework pitch.

## Usage

```
/thought-piece LinkedIn post about why 70% of AI pilots never scale
/thought-piece blog article on measuring AI transformation beyond activity metrics
/thought-piece talking points for a keynote on the human side of AI adoption
```

Or just `/thought-piece` and describe what you want.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   THOUGHT LEADERSHIP                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Understand topic, format, audience, and goal                │
│  2. Identify which frameworks apply to this topic               │
│  3. Research current examples, data points, trends              │
│  4. Draft content in Elixirr voice                              │
│  5. Share for review and iterate                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Formats

| Format | Length | Style |
|--------|--------|-------|
| LinkedIn post | 600-1200 words | Conversational, single key insight, hook in first 2 lines |
| Blog article | 1500-2500 words | Structured argument, 2-3 framework applications |
| Long-form article | 3000+ words | Deep analysis, comprehensive framework use |
| Talking points | Slide-by-slide | Outline with speaker notes |

## What Makes It Distinctive

Content is powered by Elixirr's frameworks but never cites them by name. Instead of "According to the AI Transformation Operating System...", the output uses the thinking directly: "Most organizations fail at AI not because of technology, but because they treat it as a deployment problem rather than a redesign problem."

## Workflow

This command invokes the `thought-leadership` skill. Read the skill's SKILL.md and reference files for the full workflow, then follow it step by step.
