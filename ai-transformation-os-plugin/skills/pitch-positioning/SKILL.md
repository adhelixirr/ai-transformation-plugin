# Pitch Positioning Generator

## Workflow

### 1. Clarify the Context

Understand what they need:
- **What are they pitching?** (Elixirr's full offering, a specific service, a way of thinking?)
- **Who's the audience?** (persona, company, situation)
- **What specifically do they need?** (elevator pitch, persona-specific message, competitive response, objection handling, value story?)
- **What's the medium?** (casual conversation, formal pitch meeting, email, presentation?)
- **What's the goal?** (generate interest, shift perception, close objection, move to next conversation?)

### 2. Read the Value Proposition & Voice Guides

Read these before generating output:
- `../references/value-proposition.md` (Elixirr's positioning, differentiators, buyer personas, language)
- `../references/elixirr-voice.md` (tone, vocabulary, writing patterns)

These define how we talk about what we do and why it matters.

### 3. Research if Competitive Response Needed

If they ask "how are we different from [competitor]", search for:
- Competitor's AI transformation offering
- How they position themselves
- What they claim to do
- Their typical price/engagement model
- Their methodology or framework approach

Create a brief competitive view to ground the differentiation.

### 4. Generate the Requested Output

#### Option A: Elevator Pitch (30 seconds, 60 seconds, 2 minutes)

Create three versions of increasing depth:

**30-second version** (hallway conversation, quick summary):
- One sentence hook: What we do + why it matters
- One sentence difference: How we're distinctive
- One sentence invitation: What next conversation looks like

*Example structure:*
"Most AI investments fail to scale because companies optimize for technology instead of transformation. We help leadership teams redesign how work gets done so AI actually drives business value. Worth a 30-minute conversation?"

**60-second version** (opening an actual pitch):
- Hook: Inflection point (why now, what's at stake)
- Challenge: What goes wrong (why most AI efforts fail)
- Shift: How we think about it differently
- Outcome: What's possible with the right approach
- Invitation: What comes next

*Structure*:
1. "AI adoption has hit a wall at most enterprises." (2 sentences)
2. "The bottleneck isn't technology — it's organizational design." (2 sentences)
3. "We approach it differently: organizational transformation first, technology second." (2 sentences)
4. "Companies we work with move from pilots that don't scale to sustainable AI businesses." (2 sentences)
5. "I'd love to explore whether this resonates for you." (1 sentence)

**2-minute version** (full pitch meeting opening):
- Establish credibility: Why we see this (your vantage point)
- Diagnose the situation: What we see happening in their industry
- Shift the frame: How to think about it differently
- Demonstrate: Real examples or results
- Invite: Next conversation and what to expect

*Structure*:
1. **Credibility opener** (20 seconds): "We've advised [X companies] on AI transformation over the past [Y years]. What we're seeing is..."
2. **Industry diagnosis** (30 seconds): Three Forces or industry-specific challenges
3. **Frame shift** (30 seconds): The gap between activity and transformation
4. **Example or evidence** (30 seconds): Specific situation or outcome
5. **Invitation** (10 seconds): "I'm curious whether any of this resonates..."

### Option B: Persona-Specific Messaging

Create tailored messages for different buyer types. Use personas from `../references/value-proposition.md`:

For each persona (CEO, CTO, CHRO, COO, CFO):
- **Opening hook**: What they care about (business impact, technical capability, talent, execution, ROI)
- **Why they should listen**: What's at stake for their role
- **Core message**: How Elixirr helps them succeed in their specific role
- **Proof point**: Specific example or outcome relevant to their world
- **Invitation**: Next step that feels natural to them

*Example for CTO*:
- **Hook**: "AI is being treated as an IT project instead of a business transformation"
- **What's at stake**: "Your team gets blamed for slow adoption when the real problem is organizational"
- **Core message**: "We help you design architecture that enables the business to move at the speed it needs"
- **Proof point**: "One client we worked with reduced time-to-insight by 60% by redesigning how data teams collaborate with business teams"
- **Invitation**: "Let's talk through what's actually blocking your AI roadmap"

### Option C: Competitive Differentiation

If they ask "how are we different from [competitor]?":

1. Acknowledge the competitor respectfully (what they do well)
2. State the genuine difference (not a slam, a different philosophy)
3. Give an example of what the difference means in practice
4. Invite exploration of which approach fits their situation

*Structure*:
```
"[Competitor] focuses on [their strength]. We take a different view.

We believe [our core philosophy]. That changes [specific outcome or approach].

For example: [situation where our approach wins].

Depending on your priorities, one approach might fit better than the other. What matters most to your organization?"
```

Common competitive scenarios:

**vs. Tool/Platform vendors**:
- They: "Our platform does X"
- Us: "Platforms are necessary but not sufficient. Transformation requires organizational redesign, not just technology"
- Example: "We've seen companies with best-in-class platforms fail because teams weren't redesigned to use them"

**vs. Traditional consulting**:
- They: "We'll help you plan your AI transformation"
- Us: "Planning is step one. We help you execute and embed the capability in your team"
- Example: "Most plans sit on shelves. We work iteratively, helping your team learn and build momentum"

**vs. AI implementation agencies**:
- They: "We'll build your AI solution"
- Us: "Building a solution is step one. Sustaining value requires that your team owns it and can evolve it"
- Example: "We transfer knowledge and capability to your team so you're not dependent on us"

### Option D: Objection Handling

For common objections, provide response strategies:

**"We're already doing AI"**
- Reframe: Distinguish between activity and transformation
- Response: "That's great. Most companies have pilots running. The question is whether they're scaling to create business impact or staying stuck in the pilot phase. What does your success look like?"
- Deeper: Reference maturity model — where are they really?

**"We have internal capability"**
- Acknowledge: "You likely do. Here's the challenge we see..."
- Reframe: Teams can't see their own failure patterns
- Response: "Internal teams often can't see their own organizational blind spots. An outside perspective helps diagnose what's really blocking scale. What's your biggest bottleneck right now?"

**"We just need a tool"**
- Don't argue: "Tools are important. But here's what we see..."
- Reframe: Tools without redesign = expensive shelfware
- Response: "Tools alone don't drive adoption. Teams need redesigned workflows, leadership alignment on outcomes, and governance to sustain. That's where value gets stuck."

**"We need to move fast"**
- Acknowledge urgency: "Speed matters. That's exactly why..."
- Reframe: Speed without foundation = expensive restarts
- Response: "Moving fast without the right foundation means restarting expensive projects. We help you move fast AND sustainably. That takes intentional design upfront."

**"Show me the ROI"**
- Anchor to their metric: "That depends on what you measure. Let's talk about..."
- Reframe: Outcome-first approach
- Response: "Most companies measure activity (models deployed, data ingested) instead of outcomes (revenue, efficiency, speed). We start with your outcome targets and build backwards to the capabilities you need."

**"We've tried this before and it didn't work"**
- Acknowledge failure: "What happened?"
- Diagnose: "Most failures point to one of a few patterns. Which ones sound familiar?"
- Reframe: This time is different because
- Response: "Understanding what failed is crucial. Let's diagnose whether the issue was approach, execution, leadership alignment, or something else. That shapes what's different this time."

**"We don't have budget"**
- Reframe value: "The cost of staying stuck is often higher than the cost of moving forward. Let's talk about..."
- Response: "What would success look like financially? Let's work backwards to what it would take to get there."

### Option E: Value Story

Create a narrative arc that shows outcome:

**Structure** (4-part story):
1. **Situation**: Company faced [specific challenge] in AI transformation
2. **Complication**: Without help, they'd face [specific risks or missed opportunities]
3. **Elixirr approach**: We helped them [specific method or intervention]
4. **Outcome**: Result was [specific, measurable impact]

*Example*:
"Retail company had 15 AI pilots running but couldn't get any of them to production. VP of Operations wanted to scale but faced organizational gridlock — different teams, different priorities, no shared definition of success.

Without action, they'd waste millions funding pilots that never delivered value. Leadership was ready to cut the program.

We started by aligning on what 'success' meant (financial target, not technical metrics). Then we diagnosed the organizational gaps preventing scale. We redesigned how the innovation team coordinated with operations and finance. We rebuilt the governance to focus on outcomes, not activity.

Six months later: 3 pilots moved to production, generating $4M incremental value annually. The team had built capability to manage their own pipeline. They're now self-sufficient."

**Key elements of a good value story**:
- Specific situation (real company, real challenge)
- Tension (what was at stake, why it mattered)
- Method (what we did differently)
- Measurable outcome (not "improved" but specific results)
- Capability transfer (they can now do this themselves)

### 5. Output the Results

For all generated output, deliver as:
- **Markdown** for most formats (easy to iterate, copy-paste)
- **Organized by persona** if doing persona messaging
- **Scenario-organized** if doing objection handling
- **Annotated** with context or tips where useful

### 6. Iterate & Refine

Ask the user:
- "Does this voice feel right?"
- "What's missing or off?"
- "Any objections we haven't covered?"
- "Should we create variations for different contexts?"

Refine until they're ready to use.

## Key Principles

1. **Authentic differentiation**: Never claim something we don't actually do better. Be honest about trade-offs.

2. **Start with diagnosis**: Show we understand their situation before we pitch. Questions build more trust than claims.

3. **Frameworks are invisible**: Value proposition should be understood without ever mentioning the OS, Three Forces, etc.

4. **Language matters**: Use their vocabulary (business outcomes, not technical terms) and Elixirr voice (authoritative, practical, provocative, specific).

5. **Avoid consultant clichés**: No "synergy," "leverage," "best practices," or "digital transformation." Speak plainly.

6. **Make it personal**: Address them as a peer. Respect their expertise. You're adding a lens, not solving their problem for them.

7. **Objection handling is conversation, not debate**: Acknowledge their point, reframe the situation, invite exploration. Don't argue.

8. **Measure success by next step**: Good pitch gets agreement to continue the conversation, not agreement to buy.
