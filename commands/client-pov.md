# /client-pov

Research a client's industry, company, and situation, then generate a tailored document demonstrating how Elixirr would approach their AI transformation.

## Usage

```
/client-pov Unilever — they're stuck scaling AI beyond marketing pilots
/client-pov Barclays — proposal section on organizational change architecture
/client-pov short POV for a mid-market SaaS company exploring AI for customer success
```

Or just `/client-pov` and provide details when prompted.

│  1. Collect client details and engagement context               │
│  2. Research company AI initiatives, signals, industry trends   │
│  3. Assess maturity level from public signals                   │
│  4. Identify 3-5 relevant failure patterns                      │
│  5. Map recommended approach using OS layers                    │
│  6. Draft as Markdown for review                                │
│  7. Iterate, then convert to docx for delivery                  │
